The {{ site.data.vars.Product_Short }} Actions integration with 
ServiceNow solves two major use cases:

* Create records of {{ site.data.vars.Product_Short }} decisions, associated with {{ site.data.vars.Product_Short }} 
  entities (configuration items) in the CMDB. In this scenario, auditable records are generated in 
  ServiceNow the actions that were generated or executed in {{ site.data.vars.Product_Short }}.
  
* Integrate {{ site.data.vars.Product_Short }} decisions with the ServiceNow change workflows. 
  In this case, change request must be approved in ServiceNow before executing corresponding 
  {{ site.data.vars.Product_Short }} actions. 

The integration targets {{ site.data.vars.Product_Short }} releases and can be installed in 
ServiceNow Paris, Quebec, and Rome environments.

custom business rules to create Change Requests (CRs) and to update action approval
